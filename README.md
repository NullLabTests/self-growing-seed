# üå± Self-Growing Seed AI

A visual simulation of recursive self-improvement in artificial intelligence with a terminal-inspired interface. This project demonstrates how an AI system might evolve and grow over time, visualizing the connections and nodes that represent knowledge and complexity.



## üöÄ Features

- **Real-time Visualization**: Watch as the AI seed grows and evolves in real-time with animated nodes and connections
- **Terminal Aesthetics**: Matrix-inspired UI with scanlines, glowing elements, and monospace typography
- **Simulated Code Evolution**: View simulated code samples that evolve as the AI increases in complexity
- **Audio Feedback**: Subtle sound effects for node activation, growth, and evolution events
- **Interactive Growth**: Click on nodes to activate and stimulate growth in different areas
- **Control Panel**: Adjust evolution speed and monitor growth metrics
- **Activity Log**: See what the AI is learning and how it's evolving
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

## üíª Tech Stack

- **React**: UI components and state management
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe code
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling
- **shadcn/ui**: UI component library
- **Vite**: Fast development server and bundling

## üåê Deployment

The project is ready for deployment on platforms like Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages. Simply connect your repository to any of these platforms for automatic deployment.

## üìñ How It Works

The self-growing AI seed starts with a core node and gradually expands by:

1. **Knowledge Acquisition**: Simulated learning processes that increase node knowledge
2. **Connection Formation**: Creating links between related nodes
3. **Node Activation**: Higher activity in specific nodes leads to growth in those areas
4. **Complexity Evolution**: As the network grows, overall system complexity increases
5. **Code Evolution**: Behind the scenes, simulated code samples evolve to reflect the AI's increasing capabilities

## üß† The Concept of Recursive Self-Improvement

Recursive Self-Improvement (RSI) is a hypothetical ability of artificial intelligence systems to redesign and improve themselves, creating increasingly capable versions with each iteration.

The concept originated in I.J. Good's 1965 paper "Speculations Concerning the First Ultraintelligent Machine," where he described an "intelligence explosion" resulting from a machine's ability to improve its own intelligence.

As the AI improves its own architecture and algorithms, these improvements compound, potentially leading to rapid advancement in capabilities. This visualization provides an abstract representation of how such a system might evolve, with knowledge nodes forming connections and the overall system increasing in complexity.
