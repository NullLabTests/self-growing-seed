# 🌱 Self-Growing Seed AI

A visual simulation of recursive self-improvement in artificial intelligence. This project demonstrates how an AI system might evolve and grow over time, visualizing the connections and nodes that represent knowledge and complexity.

## 🚀 Features

- **Real-time Visualization**: Watch as the AI seed grows and evolves in real-time
- **Interactive Growth**: Click on nodes to activate and stimulate growth in different areas
- **Control Panel**: Adjust evolution speed and monitor growth metrics
- **Activity Log**: See what the AI is learning and how it's evolving
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

## 💻 Tech Stack

- **React**: UI components and state management
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe code
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling
- **shadcn/ui**: UI component library
- **Vite**: Fast development server and bundling

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/self-growing-seed-ai.git
   cd self-growing-seed-ai
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:5173
   ```

## 🌐 Deployment

The project is ready for deployment on platforms like Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages. Simply connect your repository to any of these platforms for automatic deployment.

## 📖 How It Works

The self-growing AI seed starts with a core node and gradually expands by:

1. **Knowledge Acquisition**: Simulated learning processes that increase node knowledge
2. **Connection Formation**: Creating links between related nodes
3. **Node Activation**: Higher activity in specific nodes leads to growth in those areas
4. **Complexity Evolution**: As the network grows, overall system complexity increases
